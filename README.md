# Deque-and-Balanced-Expressions
A Java project implementing a custom, generic deque using a doubly linked list. It supports operations like adding/removing elements from both ends. It also includes a balanced expression checker that uses the stack-like methods of the deque to verify if delimiters in arithmetic expressions are properly paired.

# My Java Deque and Expression Balancer Project

This repository contains two key components:

- **MyDeque**: A custom implementation of a double-ended queue (deque) using a doubly linked list.
- **CheckBalance**: A program to check if an arithmetic expression has balanced delimiters using the `MyDeque` class.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the `MyDeque.java` and `CheckBalance.java` classes.

## Documentation
- HTML documentation for the project is available in the `/docs` folder.
