# Deque-and-Balanced-Expressions
A Java project implementing a custom, generic deque using a doubly linked list. It supports operations like adding/removing elements from both ends. It also includes a balanced expression checker that uses the stack-like methods of the deque to verify if delimiters in arithmetic expressions are properly paired.
